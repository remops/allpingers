++++++++++++++  AN IMPORTANT NOTE FOR ALL ECHOLOT PINGER OPERATORS  ++++++++++++++++

Some of you will have noticed that your Cypherpunk stats and keyrings
are broken. Your keyrings may be empty. Your rlist*.html pages may be blank
or may only list 1 or 2 remailers.

The reason for this is that you likely upgraded your server's GnuPG version
to 2.x.x and your current Echolot installation expects GnuPG v1.4.x and
therefore cannot recognize the new GPG UIDs and keyrings.

There is a fix for this. It is a fix to the file ~/echolot/Echolot/Conf.pm
created by Zax in 2017.

Zax hosts his own repository of Palfrader's Echolot program here

https://github.com/crooks/echolot

and I recommend that you use this modern version of Echolot in the future.

To review the code of Zax's modification to Echolot/Conf.pm see:

https://github.com/crooks/echolot/commit/090a59506113e414097d83fe67cd9041edf43811

The file Conf.pm in its modified form can be downloaded here:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crooks/echolot/master/Echolot/Conf.pm

Swap out your old Conf.pm with this modified one, restart Echolot program,
and your Cpunk pings should begin working again.
